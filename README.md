# PM2.5-emissions_visualisation
In the scope of the informaiton visualisation module MSE_InfVis, 
this semester project is a training on exploratory data analysis. Besides gaining experience with the visualisation package ggplot2,the goal of this work is to explore how the PM2.5 emissions have changed in the USA through 1999â€“2008.

Note:
The idea for project stems from one of the course assignments of the MOOC Exploratory Data Analyisis https://www.coursera.org/course/exdata, while none of the questions answered in this project answeres those ones asked in the MOOC course assignment.
